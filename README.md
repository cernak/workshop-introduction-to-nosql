## Practice

1. [Create Astra Db Instance](#1-create-astra-db-instance)
2. [Tabular Databases](#2-tabular-databases)
3. [Document Databases](#3-document-databases)
4. [Key-Value Databases](#4-keyvalue-databases)
5. [Graph Databases](#5-graph-databases)

## 1. Create Astra Db Instance

_**`ASTRA DB`** is the simplest way to run Cassandra with zero operations at all - just push the button and get your cluster. No credit card required, $25.00 USD credit every month, roughly 5M writes, 30M reads, 40GB storage monthly - sufficient to run small production workloads._

‚úÖ Register (if needed) and Sign In to Astra DB [https://astra.datastax.com](https://astra.dev/11-3): You can use your `Github`, `Google` accounts or register with an `email`.

_Make sure to chose a password with minimum 8 characters, containing upper and lowercase letters, at least one number and special character_

‚úÖ Choose "Start Free Now"

Choose the "Start Free Now" plan, then "Get Started" to work in the free tier.

You will have plenty of free initial credit (renewed each month!), roughly corresponding
to 40 GB of storage, 30M reads and 5M writes.

> If this is not enough for you, congratulations! You are most likely running a mid- to large-sized business! In that case you should switch to a paid plan.

(You can follow this [guide](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/creating-your-astra-database.html) to set up your free-tier database with the $25 monthly credit.)

![astra-db-signup](images/tutorials/astra_signup.gif)

To create the database:

- **For the database name** - `nosql_db`. While Astra DB allows you to fill in these fields with values of your own choosing, please follow our recommendations to ensure the application runs properly.

- **For the keyspace name** - `nosql1`. It's really important that you use the name "nosql1" for the code to work.

_You can technically use whatever you want and update the code to reflect the keyspace. This is really to get you on a happy path for the first run._

- **For provider and region**: Choose and provider (either GCP or AWS). Region is where your database will reside physically (choose one close to you or your users).

- **Create the database**. Review all the fields to make sure they are as shown, and click the `Create Database` button.

You will see your new database `pending` in the Dashboard.

![db-pending-state](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/shared-assets/blob/master/astra/dashboard-pending-1000-update.png?raw=true)

The status will change to `Active` when the database is ready, this will only take 2-3 minutes. You will also receive an email when it is ready.

![db-creation-walkthrough](images/tutorials/astra-create-db.gif?raw=true)

## 2. Tabular databases

In a tabular database we will store ... tables! The Astra DB Service is built on Apache Cassandra‚Ñ¢, which is tabular: it makes sense to start by this one.

> **Tabular databases** organize data in rows and columns, but with a twist from the traditional RDBMS. Also known as wide-column stores or partitioned row stores, they provide the option to organize related rows in partitions that are stored together on the same replicas to allow fast queries. Unlike RDBMSs, the tabular format is not necessarily strict. For example, Apache Cassandra‚Ñ¢ does not require all rows to contain values for all columns in the table. Like Key/Value and Document databases, Tabular databases use hashing to retrieve rows from the table. Examples include: Cassandra, HBase, and Google Bigtable.

**‚úÖ 2a. Describe your Keyspace**

At Database creation you provided a keyspace, a logical grouping for tables.
Let's visualize it.
In Astra DB go to CQL Console to enter the following commands

- *Select your db*
![image](images/01.png?raw=true)

- *Select CqlConsole*
![image](images/02.png?raw=true)

- *Enter the command*
```sql
describe keyspaces;
```

![image](images/03.png?raw=true)

**‚úÖ 2b. Create tables**

- *Execute the following Cassandra Query Language* 

```sql
use nosql1;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS videos (
 videoid   uuid,
 email     text,
 title     text,
 upload    timestamp,
 url       text,
 tags      set <text>,
 frames    list<int>,
 PRIMARY KEY (videoid)
);
```

- *Visualize structure*
```sql
describe keyspace nosql1;
```

**‚úÖ 2c. Working with DATA** :

- *Insert some entries on first table*
```sql
INSERT INTO videos(videoid, email, title, upload, url, tags, frames)
VALUES(uuid(), 
     'clu@sample.com', 
     'Introduction to Nosql Databases', 
     toTimeStamp(now()), 
     'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMDHxsGbmC8',
     { 'nosql','workshop','2021'}, 
     [ 1, 2, 3, 4]);
     
INSERT INTO videos(videoid, email, title, upload, url)
VALUES(uuid(), 
      'clu@sample.com', 
      'Demo video Y', 
      toTimeStamp(now()), 
      'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXX');

INSERT INTO videos(videoid, email, title, upload, url)
VALUES(e466f561-4ea4-4eb7-8dcc-126e0fbfd573, 
      'clu@sample.com', 
      'Yet another video', 
      toTimeStamp(now()), 
      'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABCDE');
```

- *Read values*

```sql
select * from videos;
```

- *Read by id*

```sql
select * from videos 
where videoid=e466f561-4ea4-4eb7-8dcc-126e0fbfd573;
```

**‚úÖ 2d. Working with PARTITIONS** :

But data can be grouped, we stored together what should be retrieved together.

- *Create this new table*
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users_by_city (
 city      text,
 firstname text,
 lastname  text,
 email     text,
 PRIMARY KEY ((city), lastname, email)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY(lastname ASC, email ASC);

```
- *Insert some entries*

```sql
INSERT INTO users_by_city(city, firstname, lastname, email) 
VALUES('PARIS', 'Lunven', 'Cedrick', 'clu@sample.com');

INSERT INTO users_by_city(city, firstname, lastname, email) 
VALUES('PARIS', 'Yellow', 'Jackets', 'yj@sample.com');

INSERT INTO users_by_city(city, firstname, lastname, email) 
VALUES('ORLANDO', 'David', 'Gilardi', 'dgi@sample.com');
```

- *List values with partitions keys*

```sql
SELECT * from users_by_city WHERE city='PARIS';
```

<!--

- *List values without partitions keys*
```sql
SELECT * from users_by_city WHERE lastname='Gilardi';
```

**`Yes we know`** and we will explain why.

- *Same query with debugging enabled*

```sql
tracing on;
SELECT * from users_by_city WHERE city='PARIS';
```

- *Forcing Full Scan = SLOW*
```sql
SELECT * from users_by_city WHERE lastname='Gilardi' ALLOW FILTERING;
```

- *Stop debugging*
```sql
tracing off;
```
-->

## 3. Document Databases

Let's do some hands-on with document database queries.

> **Document databases** expand on the basic idea of key-value stores where ‚Äúdocuments‚Äù are more complex, in that they contain data and each document is assigned a unique key, which is used to retrieve the document. These are designed for storing, retrieving, and managing document-oriented information, often stored as JSON. Since the Document database can inspect the document contents, the database can perform some additional retrieval processing. Unlike RDBMSs which require a static schema, Document databases have a flexible schema as defined by the document contents. Examples include: MongoDB and CouchDB. Note that some RDBMS and NoSQL databases outside of pure document stores are able to store and query JSON documents, including Cassandra.

**‚úÖ 3a. Cassandra knows JSON** :

It is not a known fact but Cassandra accepts JSON query out of the box. You can find more information [here](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql-oss/3.3/cql/cql_using/useInsertJSON.html).

- *Insert data into Cassandra with JSON*

```sql
INSERT INTO videos JSON '{
   "videoid":"e466f561-4ea4-4eb7-8dcc-126e0fbfd578",
     "email":"clunven@sample.com",
     "title":"A JSON videos",
     "upload":"2020-02-26 15:09:22 +00:00",
     "url": "http://google.fr",
     "frames": [1,2,3,4],
     "tags":   [ "cassandra","accelerate", "2020"]
}';
```

In the same way you can retrieve JSON out of Cassandra ([more info here](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql-oss/3.3/cql/cql_using/useQueryJSON.html)).

- *Retrieve data from Cassandra as JSON*

```sql
select json title,url,tags from videos;
```

![image](images/04.png?raw=true)

**‚úÖ 3b. Create your Application token** :

You need to create an Astra DB token, which will be used to interact with the
database through the Swagger UI. Once created, store its value in a safe place
(the Astra console won't show that to you again!) and do not post it in public.

To create the token from your main dashboard (where your databases are listed)
simply click on the "..." menu next to your database and choose "Generate a token".
Choose the role "Database Administrator" and click on "Generate Token".

_Alternatively, go to the Astra dashboard, open the Organization menu on the
top left and choose "Organization settings", then "Token Management" and finally
you will be able to generate a new token. Choose the role "Database Administrator"._

Download the token in CSV format and/or copy
its value to a handy place such as a text editor: we will use it immediately!

_See this [documentation](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/manage-application-tokens.html) to create your application token._ 

*The Astra DB Token looks like the following (do not copy, it's just an example)*
```
AstraCS:KDfdKeNREyWQvDpDrBqwBsUB:ec80667c....
```

**üëÅÔ∏è Walkthrough**

Quick way:

## 4. KeyValue Databases

> **Key/Value databases** are some of the least complex as all of the data within consists of an indexed key and a value. Key-value databases use a hashing mechanism such that given a key, the database can quickly retrieve an associated value. Hashing mechanisms provide constant time access, which means they maintain high performance even at large scale. The keys can be any type of object, but are typically a string. The values are generally opaque blobs (i.e., a sequence of bytes that the database does not interpret). Examples include: Redis, Amazon DynamoDB, Riak, and Oracle NoSQL database. Some tabular NoSQL databases, like Cassandra, can also service key/value needs.

**‚úÖ 4b. Create a table with GraphQL**

Navigate to the GraphQL playground, by clicking `Connect`, then `GraphQL API`, and finally you should see the URL under `Launching GraphQL Playground`. Ctrl-click or right-click the link to launch into a new tab.

![Screen Shot 2021-05-19 at 11 19 11 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23346205/118839150-452a4200-b894-11eb-8320-20b15f3b1c09.png)

Then you need to enter in your Astra DB token to authenticate and talk to the database. Notice the "server cannot be reached" message. This is simply telling you it cannot make the connection because you are not authenticated. Click on `HTTP Headers` at the bottom and paste in your token.

![Screen Shot 2021-05-20 at 8 49 48 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23346205/118981634-88de8380-b948-11eb-9ece-5f75f153020e.png)

Paste in your token.

![Screen Shot 2021-05-20 at 8 53 07 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23346205/118982115-18843200-b949-11eb-840c-acce0a0c562a.png)

Now you are ready to go.

Use this query. Since we are creating a table we want to use the `graphql-schema` tab
```
mutation {
  kv: createTable(
    keyspaceName:"nosql1",
    tableName:"key_value",
    partitionKeys: [ # The keys required to access your data
      { name: "key", type: {basic: TEXT} }
    ]
    values: [ # The values associated with the keys
      { name: "value", type: {basic: TEXT} }
    ]
  )
}
```

![Screen Shot 2021-05-20 at 8 58 13 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23346205/118982905-df988d00-b949-11eb-8584-9407c9efa80e.png)

You can check in the CQL Console as well;

```sql
use nosql1;

describe table key_value;
```

*Expected output*

![image](images/cqlconsole1.png?raw=true)

**‚úÖ 4c. Populate the table**

Any of the created APIs can be used to interact with the GraphQL data, to write or read data. Since we are working with data now and not creating schema you will need to swtich to the `graphql` tab. Also, ensure to fill in your Astra DB token again.

- *Fill the header token again*
```json
{
  "x-cassandra-token":"AstraCS:KDfdKeNREyWQvDpDrBqwBsUB:ec80667c...."
}
```

![Screen Shot 2021-05-20 at 9 04 47 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23346205/118983681-af9db980-b94a-11eb-82b7-e0c852701265.png)

Now, let‚Äôs navigate to your new keyspace `nosql1` inside the playground. Change tab to graphql and pick url `/graphql/nosql1`

![Screen Shot 2021-05-20 at 9 13 26 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23346205/118985049-1d96b080-b94c-11eb-87c4-0340e941d37c.png)


Then paste in the following query and click "play". 
![Screen Shot 2021-05-20 at 9 17 35 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23346205/118985407-6c444a80-b94c-11eb-9b7d-d83e35e40bf1.png)

- *Execute this query*
```
mutation insert2KV {
  key1: insertkey_value(value: {key:"key1", value:"bbbb"}) {
    value {
      key,value
    }
  }
  key2: insertkey_value(value: {key:"key2", value:"bbbb"}) {
    value {
      key,value
    }
  }
}
```

- Check with CQL Console

```sql
select * from key_value;
```

*Expected output:*

![image](images/graphql2.png?raw=true)

- *Execute this query*
```
mutation insert2KV {
  key1: insertkey_value(value: {key:"key1", value:"cccc"}) {
    value {
      key,value
    }
  }
}
```

- Check with CQL Console the values should have been updated. Indeed with Cassandra there are no integrity constraints, so you can de-duplicate values easily.

## 5. Graph Databases

> **Graph databases** store their data using a graph metaphor to exploit the relationships between data. Nodes in the graph represent data items, and edges represent the relationships between the data items. Graph databases are designed for highly complex and connected data, which outpaces the relationship and JOIN capabilities of an RDBMS. Graph databases are often exceptionally good at finding commonalities and anomalies among large data sets. Examples of Graph databases include DataStax Graph, Neo4J, JanusGraph, and Amazon Neptune.

Astra DB does not contain yet a way to implement Graph Databases use cases. But at Datastax Company we do have a product called [DataStax Graph](https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-graph) that you can use for free when not in production.

Today it will be a demo to be quick but you can as well do and start the demo with the following steps

**‚úÖ 5a. Prerequisites**

**Minimal Configuration**: You need to have a computer with this minimal configuration requirements
- At least 2CPU
- At least 3GB or RAM

**Install Docker and Docker Compose**

You need to install Docker and Docker-compose on your machine
- [Install **Docker** for Windows/Mac/Linux](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/kubernetes-workshop-online/blob/master/0-setup-your-cluster/README.MD#1-install-docker)
- [Install **Docker-Compose**  for Windows/Mac/Linux](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/kubernetes-workshop-online/blob/master/0-setup-your-cluster/README.MD#2-install-docker-compose)

**‚úÖ 5b. Create a docker network named 'graph'**

```bash
docker network create graph
```

üñ•Ô∏è *Expected output*
```bash
$workshop_introduction_to_nosql> docker network create graph

64f8bcc2dda416d6dc80ef3c1ac97902b9d90007842808308e9d741d179d9344
```

**‚úÖ 5c.Clone this repository (or download ZIP from the github UI)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-introduction-to-nosql.git

cd workshop-introduction-to-nosql
```

**‚úÖ 5d.Start the containers**

:warning: *Linux users:*
  >Folder `datastax-studio-config` is mapped to docker container (see: `docker-compose.yaml` file) and dse studio runs as user `studio` with `uid=997` and         >`gui=997` which needs RW access to that folder.
  >
  >Run this command if you are on a linux system:
  >```bash
